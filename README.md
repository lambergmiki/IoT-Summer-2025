# How to build a simple ambient temperature monitor
**Author:** Miki Lamberg, ml227cr

When I started this project, the initial idea was to monitor the household temperature, since the ambient temperature in my household can significantly vary during summer and massively impact the proofing of my pizza doughs. I began with a basic starter kit that included a thermistor, an _analog sensor_, rather than something like a _digital_ DHT11 (which measures temperature and humidity), deeming it redundant for my end purposes. I simply wanted a temperature monitor which would ping me if the temperature went below or above X or Y degrees, allowing me to take appropriate measures for the pizza dough (e.g. placing it in the fridge if too warm, or opposite if too cold).

However, as the project progressed, I realized I wanted more than just ambient temperature readings — I wanted to monitor the actual temperature of the dough itself. Reading the temperatures of the dough would make for
1) more accurate readings, as the dough temperature is impacted by kneading and our body temperature,
2) and I already have a household thermometer which clearly displays the ambient temperature

Ultimately, I bought a DS18B20 (see [# Material](#material)) digital sensor for this purpose.

With either the thermistor (analog) or DS18B20 (digital), building this monitor using this tutorial should take approximately 15–20 hours.
